## MVVM architecture

My Android project uses a modern technology stack that includes View Binding for efficient UI interactions, Coroutines for managing asynchronous tasks, ViewModel for handling UI-related data and lifecycle awareness, Navigation for simplifying navigation between screens, Hilt for dependency injection and managing app-level components, and Room for local data storage and database management. This stack ensures clean architecture, maintainability, and a seamless user experience.
